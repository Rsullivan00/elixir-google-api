defmodule GoogleApi.Speech.V1.Model.WordInfo do
  @moduledoc """
  Word-specific information for recognized words. Word information is only included in the response when certain request parameters are set, such as &#x60;enable_word_time_offsets&#x60;.

  ## Attributes

  - endTime (String): *Output-only* Time offset relative to the beginning of the audio, and corresponding to the end of the spoken word. This field is only set if &#x60;enable_word_time_offsets&#x3D;true&#x60; and only in the top hypothesis. This is an experimental feature and the accuracy of the time offset can vary. Defaults to: `null`.
  - startTime (String): *Output-only* Time offset relative to the beginning of the audio, and corresponding to the start of the spoken word. This field is only set if &#x60;enable_word_time_offsets&#x3D;true&#x60; and only in the top hypothesis. This is an experimental feature and the accuracy of the time offset can vary. Defaults to: `null`.
  - word (String): *Output-only* The word corresponding to this set of information. Defaults to: `null`.
